                <br>
                  <p>An Italian Restaurant co-owned by myself Vincenzo Tragni and local businessman Peter Downes.
                     We aim to serve you with traditionally cooked family dishes, offering you only authentic recipes and something different to the larger chain restaurants. 
                     La Trattoria opened on the 4th July 2011 and business has grown from strength to strength based on word of mouth alone, such is the standard of our food and service. 
                     I personally designed the menu and oversee all the cooking myself. That is why I can confidently say that all the dishes are served with pride, passion and a little bit of Italian ‘amore’.</p>

                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                  <br>
                    <p>I feel I should provide you with a little bit of background, both about myself and the origins of the dishes served in our restaurant.
                        I originally arrived in England in 1996, leaving a large family of chefs behind me, in my home town of Altamura (known as the little ‘town of bread’).       
                        I came here to help my brother, who had already set up a well established and successful Italian Restaurant in Hull (named Operetta).                        
                        Altamura is located in the region of Puglia, in southern Italy, which is not only famous for its wine and olive oil but for the passion of its people and their love of food.
                        The local region is well known for its production of vast amounts of vegetables, including aubergines and artichokes. You will find these used in many of my meat and pasta dishes.</p>
